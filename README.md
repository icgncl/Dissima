# Dissimilarity-Between-Shoulder-Implants-With-Siamese-Neural-Network
In this project, different manufacturers' shoulder implants are classified with their similarity with Siamese Neural Network. 

## Dataset
For the dataset "Shoulder Implant X-Ray Manufacturer Classification Data Set" is used from Stark et al. (2018) [1] and Urban et al. (2020) [2] works.
